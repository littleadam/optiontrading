Epic: Option Trading Strategies Automation using Python

User Stories:

1.As a trader, I want to be able to execute option trading strategies such as straddles and strangles automatically so that I can save time and minimize risk.
Acceptance Criteria: The application must execute option trading strategies automatically based on predefined market conditions and user-defined trade execution parameters.

2.As a trader, I want to be able to customize trade execution parameters such as option contract expiration date, strike price, and premium amount so that I can execute trades based on my risk appetite and market conditions.
Acceptance Criteria: The application must allow users to customize trade execution parameters and execute trades accordingly.

3.As a trader, I want to be able to access real-time market data so that I can monitor the market conditions and execute trades based on the latest information.
Acceptance Criteria: The application must use real-time market data to monitor market conditions and execute trades based on predefined criteria.

4.As a trader, I want to be able to easily navigate the application and execute trades with minimal effort so that I can focus on other aspects of my trading strategy.
cceptance Criteria: The application must have a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate the application and execute trades with minimal effort.

Sprint:

Sprint 1:
Develop a simple text file database to store information about trading strategies and market conditions.
Develop Python script that reads data from the text file database and executes predefined trading strategies.
Develop a user guide that explains how to use the application.

Sprint 2:
Develop a user-friendly interface for the application.
Develop a module that allows users to customize trade execution parameters.
Test and debug the application.

Sprint 3:
Integrate real-time market data into the application.
Develop a module that allows users to monitor market conditions and execute trades based on the latest information.
Test and debug the application.

Sprint 4:
Develop a sample text file database containing predefined trading strategies and market conditions for users to test the application.
Conduct user acceptance testing and refine the application based on feedback.
Conclusion:
The above epic, user stories, acceptance criteria, and sprint plan provide a clear roadmap for developing an application that automates option trading strategies using Python scripting. The application will minimize risk and enhance efficiency for traders, while the user-friendly interface will make it accessible to novice traders. The proposed sprint plan will ensure that the application is developed and tested in a timely and efficient manner.
