Budget Proposal:
===============
Personnel Costs:
Developer: $8,000 per month (for 4 months) = $32,000
Designer: $5,000 per month (for 2 months) = $10,000
Project Manager: $6,000 per month (for 4 months) = $24,000
Total Personnel Costs = $66,000

Software and Tools:
Python Libraries (e.g. Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn): $500
Real-time market data subscription: $2,000
User Interface Design Tools (e.g. Sketch, Figma): $1,000
Web Hosting: $500
Total Software and Tools Costs = $4,000
